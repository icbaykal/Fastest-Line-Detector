The Quality factor which appears in the groupings reflects the amount of
information available about the grouping. In the case of overlapping parallel
and V/L junction line pairs the quality factor is defined by:

	Line1->Length/LengthOfOverlapWithVirtualLine *
	Line2->Length/LengthOfOverlapWithVirtualLine 

In the case of non-overlapping parallel/collinear the factor is:

 	Line1->Length + Line2->Length/
       LengthOfOverlapWithVirtualLine

In the case of T and Lambda junctions the factor is: 

	Line(i)->Length/LengthOfOverlapWithVirtualLine

Where Line(i) is the line segment which does not go thorough the junction 
point. The end points of the Virtual line in these cases are the junction point
and the end point of Line(i) furthest away from the junction point.
